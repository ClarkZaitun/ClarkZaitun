- 👋 Hi, my name is @ClarkZaitun
- 👀 I am interested in the field of humanoid robots and industry (CNC, PLC, PAC...). After learning Rust, I also became interested in blockchain and virtual currency.
- I am very familiar with the EtherCAT protocol and user application scenarios
- 🌱 I am learning ROS2 and Rust. I believe that EtherCAT's openness, high performance, and low cost can shine in the field of humanoid robots.
- 💞️ I am looking for cooperation in EtherCAT master station, EtherCAT application layer, network card driver, and real-time system.
- 📫 My email is Clark_Zaitun@outlook.com
